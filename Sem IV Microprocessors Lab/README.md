  Folder includes programs for Microprocessors Laboratory as per VTU syllabus 2011-2012
  
  Subject Code : 10CSL48
  
# Problem Statements : 
  * Software Problems : 
    1.  Search a key element is a list of 'n' 16-bit numbers using the Binary Search algorithm.
    2.  Write the ALP modules stored in two different files; one module is to read a character from the keyboard and the other one is to display a character. Use the above two modules to read a string of characters from the keyboard terminated by the carriage return and print the string on the display in the next line.
    3.  Sort a given set of 'n' numbers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
    4.  Read an alphanumeric character and display its equivalent ASCII code at the center of the screen.
    5.  Reverse a given string and check whether it is a palindrome or not.
    6.  Read two strings, store them in locations STR1 and STR2. Check whether they are equal or not and display appropriate messages. Also display the length of the stored strings.
    7.  Read your name from the keyboard and display it at at specified location on the screen after the messagae "What is your name?". You must clear the screen before display.
    8.  Compute nCr using recursive procedure. Assume that 'n' and 'r' are non-negative integers.
    9.  Read the current time from the system and display it in the standard format on the screen.
    10.  Write a program to simulate a Decimal Up-counter to display 00-99.
    11.  Read a pair of input co-ordinates in BCD and move the cursor to the specified location on the screen.
    12.  Write a program to create a file (input file) and to delete an existing file.

# REQUIREMENTS

## ASSEMBLER
  To run these codes, an assembler is required.
  MASM 8086 has been used to develop and test the codes. A copy of the assembler has been included in the repository.

## DOS-ENVIRONMENT
  If an OS supprting execution of dos commands is not available, emulators can be used.
  Two such emulators are :
  1.  DosBox - http://www.dosbox.com/
  2.  DosEmulator (Only Linux and some unix systems) - http://www.dosemu.org/
  DosEmulator allows hardware support, while DosBox doesn't. Either could be used for software programs.
